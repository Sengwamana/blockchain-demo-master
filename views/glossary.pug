          h4 SHA-256 Hash
        p A cryptographic function that takes any input and produces a fixed 64-character hexadecimal string. The same input always produces the same output. Even a tiny change to the input completely changes the hash.

          h4 Block
        p A container that bundles together a block number, data, a nonce, and a hash. Blocks are the fundamental building units of a blockchain.

          h4 Nonce
        p "Number used Once." A number that miners search for during mining. When found, it makes the block's hash start with a required number of zeros (e.g., 0000).

          h4 Mining / Proof of Work
        p The process of trying different nonce values until finding one that produces a hash starting with the required zeros. This proves computational work was done.

          h4 Blockchain
        p A sequence of blocks where each block contains the hash of the previous block. Changing one block invalidates all subsequent blocks, making tampering evident.

          h4 Distributed / Decentralized
        p Multiple independent computers (peers/nodes) each maintain their own copy of the blockchain. The majority agrees on the correct version — no central authority needed.

          h4 Genesis Block
        p The very first block in a blockchain (Block #1). Its "Previous Hash" is all zeros since there is no block before it.

          h4 Transaction (Tx)
        p A record of value transfer between two parties — includes a sender, receiver, and amount. Multiple transactions are bundled into a single block.

          h4 Coinbase Transaction
        p The first transaction in every block. It has no sender — it creates brand new coins as a reward for the miner who successfully mined the block.

          h4 Difficulty
        p The number of leading zeros required in a valid hash. More zeros = harder to mine = more computational work needed. Bitcoin adjusts this every ~2 weeks.

          h4 51% Attack
        p A theoretical attack where someone controls more than half the network's computing power, allowing them to rewrite the blockchain. Extremely costly in practice.

          h4 Previous Hash (Prev)
        p Each block stores the hash of the block before it. This field is what chains the blocks together and makes tampering with earlier blocks detectable.
